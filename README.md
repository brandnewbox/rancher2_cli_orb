# Rancher2 CLI Orb

A Rancher2 CLI orb for CircleCI.

Based heavily on the [doctl orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/digitalocean/cli).

Check out all the details on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/brandnewbox/rancher2_cli).

# Updating?

Don't forget to bump the version in `.circleci/config.yml` and in the example in `src/orb.yml` everytime!
